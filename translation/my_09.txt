801
At the head of the companion, Ogle found his progress barred by Blood, who confronted him, a sudden sternness in his face and in every line of him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

802
Don't think I accept it willingly.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

803
A murderer--I?  he said at last.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

804
I've been hunting him this year past.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

805
At that moment a lane was opened in the ranks of the men, and through this came Miss Bishop followed by her octoroon woman.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

806
They are ships of the Jamaica fleet,  his lordship answered her.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

807
And for what had he placed himself in this position? For the sake of a girl who avoided him so persistently and intentionally that he must assume that she still regarded him with aversion.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

808
You may be right, and you may be wrong.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

809
You have granted, I am told, the King's commission to this man.  His very tone betrayed the bitterness of his rancour.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

810
She was very white, and she kept her eyes upon her folded hands.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

811
So they've told you about that!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

812
She realized that perhaps she had, herself, provoked his anger.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

813
I shall always be grateful.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

814
Not for his niece, not for his daughter, not for his own mother, would he forgo the blood what he thinks due to him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

815
Abeam with the Arabella, across the harbour, were the flat-fronted white buildings of that imposing city that came down to the very water's edge.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

816
In my own I've done nothing at all that I am ashamed of, considering the provocation I received.   Her glance faltered, and fell away before his own that was so intent.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

817
And maybe it won't.  Slow and mocking came Wolverstone's voice to answer the other's confident excitement, and as he spoke he advanced to Blood's side, an unexpected ally.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

818
You were just an unfortunate gentleman then.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

819
Thoughtfully he stroked his golden beard.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

820
It was she now who was on her defence, her voice quivering with indignation.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

821
Captain Blood bared his head and bowed silently in a greeting which she returned composedly and formally.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

822
There had been trouble with Bishop from the moment of landing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

823
Meanwhile Ogle was growing impatient.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

824
Lord Julian was sententious, as I gather that he often was.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

825
Aye--a deal of lies, devil a doubt, as I could prove to you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

826
What better way?  he demanded.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

827
But I was in haste to land you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

828
You should have seen the danger.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

829
I realize fully what you did, and I realize that partly, at least, you may have been urged by consideration for myself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

830
He did not trouble to rise, not even when Lord Julian, obeying the instincts of finer breeding, set him the example.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

831
I'll not be detaining you any longer, ma'am.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

832
Life can be infernally complex,  he sighed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

833
Wolverstone squared himself defiantly before his captain   I'll see Colonel Bishop in hell or ever I lies to for him.  And he spat, presumably for purposes of emphasis.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

834
It's our only chance....   The rest of his words were drowned in the shouts of the hands insisting that the girl be given up to be held as a hostage.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

835
That is not in the bargain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

836
I... I believe that he has,  said Calverley, between doubt and suspicion.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

837
And though he should dare attempt it, be sure that his own officers will not dare to do other than oppose him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

838
Your resolve delivered me from a horrible danger,  she admitted.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

839
It is an honourable service.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

840
He observed her pale and tense, with parted lips and startled eyes that were fixed upon him, an anxious witness of this deciding of her fate.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

841
And she shivered at the memory of it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

842
Aye!  roared in chorus the buccaneers below, and one or two of them elaborated that affirmation.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

843
You're not very civil, sir, as I have already noticed.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

844
Wait!  He swung back to face the Captain, who had placed a hand on is shoulder and was smiling, a trifle wistfully.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

845
He looked up in surprise, and then sat conning her with brooding glance.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

846
In the cabin he flung into a chair, and exploded, with a violence altogether foreign to his nature.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

847
I killed him, it is true.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

848
Captain,  he said, and as he spoke he pointed to the pursuing ships,  Colonel Bishop holds us.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

849
That'll cool Colonel Bishop's heat, maybe.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

850
Your station is on the gun-deck.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

851
But Pitt, although he shared it, was prompt to obey.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

852
He had been a fortnight in Port Royal, his ship virtually a unit now in the Jamaica squadron.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

853
So I heard,  she admitted in a small voice.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

854
If you will go below, and get your gear and your woman, you shall presently be sent aboard one of the ships of the fleet.  He pointed to the boat as he spoke.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

855
There's a thorn or two left on me.  And with a laugh Blood departed to his cabin.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

856
But laugh though he might, he knew as well as Pitt that in going ashore that morning he carried his life in his hands.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

857
I... I had not dreamed....
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

858
Believe me, I am very grateful.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

859
But there is no hope for him in that!  she cried.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

860
We went about, and it's been a race ever since.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

861
That was in Bridgetown on the night of the Spanish raid.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

862
Blood broke the seal, and read.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

863
In that garden's main avenue, that was fringed with palm and sandalwood, he had caught sight of Miss Bishop alone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

864
I will take leave to doubt it.  His lordship's tone abated nothing of its asperity.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

865
There was here quite plainly a vague threat, a mutinous spirit he could not understand.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

866
Don't be forgetting that.   Jeremy clenched his hands.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

867
Mine is the safe and easy way.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

868
Her presence at this moment, and considering the nature of his altercation with Wolverstone, was embarrassing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

869
But it gave no pause to the gunner's intention.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

870
But Blood's mind was now made up.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

871
Why, as I was just telling his lordship here, who thought like you that having Miss Bishop aboard would make us safe, not for his mother would that filthy slaver forgo what's due to him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

872
In his cabin on the starboard side Lord Julian, disturbed by the same sounds, was already astir and hurriedly dressing.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

873
And who the devil may you be?  he exploded at last.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

874
Colder still and more distant than ever grew his lordship's voice.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

875
Let me present Captain Blood.   Perforce Bishop must put on the best face he could command.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

876
Steady, Old Wolf! Steady!  Captain Blood admonished him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

877
Out of the tail of his single eye he had espied a trim figure in grey silk that was ascending the companion.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

878
No.  Blood closed his telescope.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

879
And that was practically the end of the matter.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

880
‘Swounds! Perhaps you'll explain yourself? Whither has Wolverstone gone?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

881
Pitt, at his post beside the helmsman, turned intrepidly to face the excited gunner.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

882
Blood leaned over the rail to speak to the fair young man immediately below him by the helmsman at the whipstaff.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

883
The country is all, sir; the sovereign naught.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

884
His hand closed over the butt of one of the pistols slung before him.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

885
Since when have you commanded on the main deck, Ogle? I take my orders from the Captain.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

886
It gives him a grievance at last.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

887
Wait!  Blood bade him, interrupting, and he set a restraining hand upon the gunner's arm.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

888
There's no heaving to for such a matter as that unless you wants to make quite sure of our being sunk.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

889
And for all that he lost nothing of his outward stern composure, fear invaded his heart.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

890
But Wolverstone would not stop.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

891
He beheld himself to be as the dog in the fable that had dropped the substance to snatch at a delusive shadow.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

892
If it is a mistake to grant Captain Blood a commission, the mistake is not mine.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

893
Through her and through you.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

894
Though we had a cargo of Bishop's nieces it wouldn't make him hold his hand.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

895
If now he can show that....
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

896
That is what we were advised.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

897
How?  she asked him with a sudden startled interest.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

898
‘Twill be a kindness, so it will.   For a moment she stood before him with quickened breathing, the colour ebbing and flowing in her cheeks.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

899
He was moved to raise his voice above its usual languid level.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

900
My name is Wade--Lord Julian Wade.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
