So I went to, I went to Washington D.C. and I didn't go directly to, uh, that, uh, they had told me to on my orders.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

125
That's why I didn't graduate college, but I never, I never read any of the books I was supposed to.

She was a light-skinned black person.

<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

130
So Granny got up, and she kind of walked down the steps off the porch and she was walking up towards the road and she then just stood there.

134
OK, can you hear me?
အိုကေ၊ မင်းငါ့ကို ကြားရလား။

135
It was still cultural area but suburbs was still the dominant form.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

136
And then I heard him leave, so I'm still finishing what I had to do.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

137
Um, are there any, you said you don't remember reading anything in particular, like when you were older in school, were there any books that you read that you liked or hated?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

138
And they found this house or this apartment building or whatever it was that they could live in, and it was right on the edge of Broad Street.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

139
It's a little screw which set an injection but the, the breathing pressure tube to the pilot and counter pressure.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

140
She's like, Don't worry about it, you know, just take your time.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

141
President Kennedy says to the pilots, says, Gentlemen you take good pictures.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

142
And I was like, I'm almost done.
ငါပြီးတော့မှာပါလို့ ပြန်ပြောလိုက်တယ်။

143
I tried to jot everything down.
ငါ တတ်နိုင်သလောက်တော့ ရေးမှတ်ထားခဲ့တယ်။

144
No, she was born in 1900 because she was 16, and so it must have been like in 1926, 19, you know, before, before 1930.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

145
It would not explode without the trigger.

146
So it was just really interesting.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

147
Her sister could pass for white, and in fact did pass for white.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

148
Well, he was almost, old enough to be her daddy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

149
That, I was the only 922 which was life support man the other man was a physiological support.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

150
And here I am thinking he's going come in there and be like, you know, just have it out with me, you know, just tell me off like how could I not have this done.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

151
Well of, of course, needless to say, we had a, we could not make a mistake.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

152
And, uh, but, uh, I would think, at night I couldn't sleep.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

153
One thing that she really had as a great defense.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

154
Um, as far as never being told--
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

155
So he, we lived in this area.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

156
And he's like talking all fast; he's on a cell phone.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

157
I can't remember what it was but I suddenly got really nervous that I was about to go to school for the first time and that was probably the most stressful day of my life.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

158
And so when they told her she had to go home with this guy, she said, Go home with him?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

159
I was living, uh, right outside of St. Louis, between Jefferson City and St. Louis, MO.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

160
And our father always told us not to say they are animals.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

161
I was reporting to a certain place in Del Rio, then I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base, which had just re-opened.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

162
I don't care if you don't know anything about it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

163
I don't care how you do it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

164
So then I look up, I find out where Ramona's at, and I call her over there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

165
Even though I don't see how he could have expected me to have it done.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

166
In the meantime the Air Force bought the SR71, now the A-12, that we were working with the CIA.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

167
So her sister's husband was light-skinned too?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

168
But as she got older, um, she never acknowledged that she was wrong but she did change her behavior.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

169
I never did see, and don't know yet why, unless it was just ex, ex, expressing the, the, the need to know what you was a doing and whatever.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

170
My uncle, he's a great guy.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

171
I went to my sister's that lived there . Her husband was in the service and worked with Intelligence, and I went to their house.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

172
I would think, Well, I'm, I'm going to let somebody else go, but then I would think, My God!
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

173
They asked a few questions and I answered them and they said, Get your baggage and leave there immediately, and come to the address you were supposed to when you arrived in Washington.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

174
One minute he's banging on the desk, the next he's OK, have it on my desk, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

175
Come to find out it was a U2 aircraft but we couldn't, we could not say one word about what it was; nothing to our wives, kids or anybody.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

176
So anyway, um, he ended up coming in there and he was like, How's it coming along?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

177
Then I was spinning my wheel for about, I don't know, it seemed like all day that day.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

178
And she had tuberculosis and I never knew that either.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

179
You know, you can't, you cannot survive if you don't have any counter pressure, increase breathing pressure in those altitudes.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

180
If, if your hand was exposed outside of the pressure suit, your hands would go to about five times the size, if you had a decompression.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

181
Is there any reason why she didn't tell you?
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

182
They had wound up starting out to New York to visit some relatives of this, this cousin, and they just stayed and he didn't know how to get back, so he just stayed with them.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

183
I started immediately, uh, uh, training into that from the other two guys that was at the location.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

184
No, it was just that one time in the morning, and she said that she was going to come back to the office.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

185
We didn't know what a U2 was and nobody knew anything about a U2.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

186
If it was off one iota, you had to do some adjusting to the regulator itself.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

187
Uh, I was still the one and only nine two-two that had ever set the injection on the regulator.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

188
She didn't even understand the marriage ceremony, she didn't even know that she had gotten married, really--
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

189
We would go in there.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

190
And it was like she was rejecting who she was, in some ways, by, you know, the way she treated you know, the other grandchildren.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

191
It was really cool, and the dress kind of blew in the wind a little bit--
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

192
Uh, I spent much of my time in, uh, Special Activities.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

193
And I asked him, you know, could I do it, um, Do you need me to stay and do it tonight or I could have it done by lunchtime tomorrow, if that's OK.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

194
But uh, they lived in a little country town outside of Augusta called Evans, and Evans still exists, and that's where a lot of my relatives still, still are too.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

195
My sister keeps telling me, she says, Sometimes you're just like Granny, you treat people wrong for the wrong reasons.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

196
Um, then we moved to a new house.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

197
My grandmother was born in 1910, she was a little girl.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

198
I was like, OK, well that's good, you know, like that.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

199
And the spots of paint would change every hundred degrees, it might be red, it change to blue.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>

200
I ate real quick, as fast as I could and then she came in there and she ended up helping me with it.
<MYANMAR UNICODE TRANSLATION HERE>
